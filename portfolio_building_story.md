# The Architecture of Me: Building a Living Portfolio

It started with a simple, creeping realization: a standard, static portfolio just wasn't going to cut it. I didn’t just want a digital resume; I wanted a living, breathing extension of myself on the internet. A place that felt cinematic, slightly chaotic, deeply technical, and undeniably human. 

My core philosophy has always been *"Namakk sett aakam"* (Let's make it happen). So, I grabbed my coffee, opened VS Code, and decided to build something ridiculous.

This is the story of how I over-engineered my portfolio, fought through a barrage of bizarre bugs, and built an interactive digital playground powered by React, Sanity CMS, and a custom AI clone of myself.

## Phase 1: The Foundation and the CMS Headache

I knew from the start I didn’t want to hardcode anything. If I learned a new skill or finished a project, I wanted to update it from my phone without touching a Git repository. So, I wired up a React frontend to a Sanity CMS backend. 

The idea was beautiful: a headless CMS feeding structured data into sleek React components. The execution? A headache.

Almost immediately, I ran into Sanity CORS errors. My local dev server was screaming at me because I hadn't whitelisted `localhost:3000`. Once I fixed that, I realized I had to design custom schemas for *everything*. I ended up building schemas for Projects, Achievements, Milestones, Skills, and even my Contact info. 

The craziest part? Writing a script (`seed.js`) to migrate all my hardcoded data into the Sanity database. Watching that script successfully populate the cloud database for the first time felt like magic.

## Phase 2: Aesthetics and the GPU Meltdown

I wanted the site to feel premium, dark, and tactile. I spent hours obsessing over typography, mixing *Space Grotesk* for technical precision, *Bodoni Moda* for cinematic elegance in the hero section, and *Fira Code* for that developer aesthetic.

Then came the "Liquid Glass" custom cursor. I built this beautiful, pulsing, inverted-color shard of glass that followed your mouse. It looked incredible. But there was a massive problem: the site started lagging horribly when scrolling. 

I popped open the Chrome DevTools performance profiler and found the culprit. I had used CSS `@keyframes` to animate a `filter: drop-shadow()` on the cursor, and I had layered a massive SVG `feTurbulence` filter over the entire background to create "sensor grain." 

Every time the user scrolled a single pixel, the browser's rendering engine was forced to mathematically recalculate the fractal noise and the drop-shadow for the entire viewport. I was basically mining Bitcoin on my visitors' GPUs. 

**The Fix:** I killed the drop-shadow animation, keeping it static. For the digital texture, I completely ripped out the heavy SVG math and replaced it with a microscopic, repeating CSS `linear-gradient` grid that perfectly faked analog grain without any calculation. Adding a quick `transform: translateZ(0)` forced the texture onto its own dedicated hardware layer. Suddenly, the site was buttery smooth at 60fps again.

## Phase 3: Making it Rain (Literally)

I wanted the environment to feel dynamic. So, I integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to check the real-time weather in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. 

If it's sunny, the navbar glows with warmth. If it's raining, things get interesting. I built a custom HTML5 Canvas component (`RainDroplets.js`) that renders physics-based water droplets sliding down the glass of the navbar. 

Of course, my first iteration of the rain effect lagged out because I was drawing complex radial gradients for every single droplet, 60 times a second. I had to refactor the canvas draw loop to use simple arcs, throttle the refresh rate to ~30fps, and recycle "stuck" droplets to keep the memory footprint low. When it finally worked, seeing those tiny droplets stick to the bottom of the navbar was incredibly satisfying.

## Phase 4: The Spotify Integration

Music is a huge part of my late-night coding sessions, so I wanted a "Now Playing" widget. I tapped into the Spotify Web API.

This sounded easy until I hit the OAuth wall. Spotify's access tokens expire every hour. I had to build a serverless function in Vercel (`api/spotify.js`) to securely hold my `CLIENT_SECRET` and `REFRESH_TOKEN`, silently generating a new access token on the fly every time a user visited the site. 

But I didn't stop there. I added logic so that if I wasn't listening to anything, it would fetch my "Recently Played" track instead. Finally, I extracted the `preview_url` from the API response and added a frosted-glass play button overlay on the album art. Now, visitors can literally click the widget and listen to a 30-second audio snippet of exactly what I'm vibing to. 

## Phase 5: Easter Eggs and X-Ray Vision

A portfolio shouldn't be boring. I wanted visitors to explore.

I built a global event listener system that watches for specific key presses. If you type the Konami code (`↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A`), the entire website does a barrel roll. If you type `thanos`, half the DOM elements turn to dust. If you type `matrix`, a digital rain overlay takes over.

I also hid a mini-game. If you click the "ADHY" logo in the navbar exactly 5 times, it triggers a slick, modal-based Tic-Tac-Toe (or a Zip Game on mobile) where you play against a nearly unbeatable AI. 

But my favorite feature is **X-Ray Mode**. By clicking a small activity icon in the navbar, the CSS physically strips away the styling, revealing the bare DOM wireframes and popping up little green terminal tooltips that explain the underlying tech stack of each component. It’s a developer's love letter to the web.

## Phase 6: Mini-Adhy and the Token Crisis

The crown jewel of the portfolio is "Mini-Adhy", a floating AI chatbot living in the bottom corner, powered by the Google Gemini API. 

I didn't want a generic assistant. I wanted it to sound exactly like me. I wrote a massive "Persona Neural Network Architecture" system prompt instructing the AI to be a creator-engineer hybrid, to use cinematic thinking, and to prioritize authenticity. 

To make it smart, I dynamically fetched my entire life history from the Sanity CMS—every project, skill, milestone, and bio paragraph—and injected it directly into the AI's system prompt before sending it to Gemini. 

It was brilliant. The bot knew everything about me and spoke with my exact tone. 

Then it broke. 

*“Something went wrong — API 429 Too Many Requests.”*

I had hit the Gemini free-tier limits almost instantly. Why? Because on every single chat message, I was sending:
1. A 300-line JSON-style persona prompt.
2. The *entire* Sanity CMS database text.
3. The *entire* ever-growing conversation history.

By the third chat message, I was blasting the API with over 5,000 tokens per request. 

**The Fix:** I had to become ruthless with my token economy. I compressed the massive 300-line persona into a punchy 10-line text summary that preserved the exact same vibe. Then, I wrote a slicing algorithm in the chat history array to ensure that Gemini only ever receives the last 6 messages (the last 3 interactions). The frontend UI still shows the whole chat, but the AI only reads the recent context. Token usage dropped by 70%, and the bot became lightning fast and perfectly stable.

## The Final Polish

As I geared up for deployment, I added a tiny text hint at the bottom of the footer: *"Hint: Try clicking the logo 5 times ✨"*, sitting right opposite to *"BUILT WITH LATE NIGHT CODING SESSIONS & CAFFEINE IN KERALA"*.

Building this wasn't just about putting my projects on a screen. It was an exercise in debugging, optimizing, and finding the balance between wild creative ideas and strict Lighthouse performance scores. 

There were moments where things completely broke—like the time my local dev server crashed because I renamed the Gemini API key without prefixing it properly, leading to a weird fallback error loop. But every bug forced me to dig deeper into React hooks, intersection observers, and browser rendering pipelines.

The result is a piece of the internet that feels entirely mine. It's built, it's shipped, and it's alive. 

*Namakk sett aakam.*
